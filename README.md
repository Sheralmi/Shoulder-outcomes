# Deriving conclusions from clinical research using Clustering

In clinical studies comparing two or more treatment options, subjective and objective outcomes measures are often used to determine which treatment option is better. Mean outcome scores are compared between two treatment options. The treatment option with the SIGNIFICANTLY highest mean outcome scores is determined to be the best treatment.

This approach is based on traditional statistical approach of hypothesis formulation and testing.

Recent advances in methods of dealing with big data have changed the traditional statistical thinking. Having a lot of data, scientists now observe patterns of data and based on these patterns they either derive conclusions or formulate hypotheses for further research.

In this exercise we will inspect data of patients who had one of the two types of surgery for shoulder instability.

With the latter approach we can better compare between different patients because we can simultaneously evaluate several outcome measures (i.e. mental health together with physical outcome) and to account for their components (i.e. in functional assessment to account for different scores for pain and range of motion even if total score is similar).

One point that may be overlooked in clinical research is focus on patients who did not do well. We can also investigate for causes of adverse outcomes in these patients.
